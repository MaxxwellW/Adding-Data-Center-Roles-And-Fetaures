<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 22.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Establish 2 or more compters on a network. This will ensure a way to view change in data. Will be using Virtual Machines as a means of demonstration.
- Step 2: Install Sharkwire into computer that will relay info to other computer in the network. Will initiate 'ping' then a continuous ping to setup for Firewall Rule.
- Step 3: Create new rule within network securuty group firewall.
- Step 4: Check if ping has been stopped and ensure firewall was efficient.
